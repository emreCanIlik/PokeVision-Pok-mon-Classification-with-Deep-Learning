Pokémon dataset includes approximately 40 images for each of the 1,000 Pokémon species, organized into subdirectories by class. Each image is in PNG format and resized to 128x128 pixels. Initially created for a Pokédex project in Flutter, it is recommended to apply data augmentation when using this dataset for model training.
